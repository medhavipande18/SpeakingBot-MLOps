Batch Merge lets you save your results to a 32-bit HDR file so you can refine it later. In some cases, this might be all you need to get the look you were hoping for. In other cases, you'll want to adjust the results in Exposure Merge. New! Photo Blend: Getting a group shot where everyone looks their best just got a lot easier with Photo Blend. This new feature lets you combine the best features from a series of photos to create a perfect image. For example, you can swap out a blinking photo subject from one picture for a better shot of that person. And if the only thing that stands between a good photo and a perfect one is an unwanted element, Photo Blend makes it easy to remove unwanted portions of images. You can even get creative by showing the same person multiple times in a single photo. New! Fill Light and Clarity filter: Using this one powerful filter, you can fine-tune the brightness and clarity of your photos. The Fill Light/Clarity filter simplifies brightening shadows or darkening light areas without affecting other portions of the image. You can also soften or sharpen subtle yet important details in shots. New! Selective Focus: This new effect lets you transform a real shot into a miniature model. Selective Focus, often referred to as a tilt-shift effect, lets you intuitively adjust the depth of field and increase saturation to create the illusion of a toy-like miniature scene from a photo. You can also use Selective Focus to draw attention to important parts of an image by blurring out busy surrounding details. New! Vignette: PaintShop Pro X4 makes this classic photo effect easier than ever to create, tweak, and apply. The new Vignette feature adds a soft outer border that fades to white or black so you can draw attention to the most important part of your shot.

In addition, new highlight recovery options mean that you can restore detail in overexposed areas. Enhanced! 16-bit support: PaintShop Pro X4 has extended 16-bit support to a range of tools and adjustments, giving you even more precision and flexibility when working with RAW formats. Over 20 tools have been upgraded to 16-bit support, including the Scratch Remover, Paint Brush, Object Remover, Color Replacer, Warp Brush, Mesh Warp, and Background Eraser. Performance Enhanced! Application speed: PaintShop Pro X4 has more than 75 performance updates, including GPU optimizations, that help ensure a fast, efficient working environment.

Skin Smoothing, Smart Carver, Depth of Field, Blur, and Smart Photo Fix have also been refined to offer enhanced speed and performance. In addition, Camera RAW decoding is faster than ever. Enhanced! Full-screen review: The Quick Review feature has been tweaked to offer full-screen image review so you can quickly and easily view, delete, rotate, and rate your photos. Usability New! MUI support: Great if you're working on a multilingual dual-byte system, new native multilingual user interface (MUI) support means that you can display text from multiple interface languages on a single PC. Now, there's never a problem working with photos that have foreign characters in their filename. Enhanced! Workspace: PaintShop Pro X4 has been redesigned so you can move between photo workflows in a click. The application has three tabbed workspaces each dedicated to a different stage in the digital-photography workflow. The Manage workspace gives you everything you need to review and organize your photos. You can find the most frequently used image-correction tools in the Adjust workspace, and the Edit workspace provides you with a full range of professional-level editing tools. No matter which workspace you're in, the Organizer palette is always displayed, so there's no need to go to a separate workspace or application to find more photos. New!

Amazon.com AutoCAD Freestyle is the simple design tool for smart ideas. It's easy-to-use, low-cost 2D drawing software ideal for creating professional-looking drawings, layouts, and plans that you can share. No training required. It has a simple user interface, just the tools you need, and pre-drawn symbols to start drawing right away. Then you can share your drawings with nearly anyone, because AutoCAD Freestyle produces files in the same format used by AutoCAD, genuine DWG, in addition to high-quality PDF, DWF, JPEG, PNG, or BMP files for digital communication, archiving, and reuse. The Simple Design Tool for Smart Ideas Clearly Communicate Ideas Use AutoCAD Freestyle to deliver highly polished drawings to clients, architects, contractors, and other project partners--it's better than a hand sketch any day. Share your drawings with nearly anyone, because AutoCAD Freestyle produces files in the same format used by AutoCAD: genuine DWG. You can also more efficiently create high-quality PDF, DWF, JPEG, PNG, or BMP files for digital communication, archiving, and reuse. Get Started Quickly It's exceptionally easy for people unfamiliar with CAD software to use AutoCAD Freestyle. Download it and start drawing right away--without any training. AutoCAD Freestyle has a simple user interface and just the tools you need to draw floor plans and layouts quickly and easily, all in one place. Check out the AutoCAD Freestyle community site to get productive faster, with support from video tutorials and user-submitted tips. Leave No Room for Error AutoCAD Freestyle lets you draw quickly without sacrificing quality. Create accurate, detailed plans and layouts to scale with a simplified toolset for creating standard shapes (lines, arc, circle rectangle), annotating your drawings (dimension, text, fills), sketching, doodling, and inserting images and symbols. The grid on your drawing surface helps you understand spatial dimensions, such as proportion and distance, to solve problems more easily. It's just like drawing on graph paper. Don't Start from Scratch When you use AutoCAD Freestyle, you don't have to reinvent the wheel. To save time, select from a library of pre-drawn, commonly used symbols--such as doors and windows--or insert and trace over a photograph. If you don't want to start from scratch, start with one of the sample drawings provided or download one from the AutoCAD Freestyle community site. Built for You AutoCAD Freestyle is ideal for drawing garden and landscape designs, room addition and remodeling plans, electrical schematics, custom parts, and more. Unlike other general drawing and office productivity software, AutoCAD Freestyle is purpose-built for creating plans and layouts. If you need simplified 2D drawing software you can use without training, AutoCAD Freestyle is for you. Key Features Simple User Interface An intuitive user interface and straightforward icons make AutoCAD Freestyle easy to use. No Training Required Integrated and online learning tools teach you how to use AutoCAD Freestyle while you're drawing. The AutoCAD Freestyle community siteoffers additional resources to help you get productive faster, including video tutorials and user-submitted tips. Real-World Dimensions Create accurate, detailed drawings, plans, and layouts to scale. Share Your Work Print your design or share it digitally as a PDF, DWF, JPEG, PNG, or BMP file. Only the Tools You Need Start drawing right away with simple 2D drawing tools. No Need to Start from Scratch Insert a photograph and trace over it to communicate your design ideas. Hundreds of Predrawn Symbols Start designing right away with commonly used symbols, such as kitchen appliances, trees, and shrubs. Create Files That CAD Professionals Use Whether you want to view files created in AutoCAD software or share your ideas with CAD professionals, it's simple because AutoCAD Freestyle is AutoCAD compatible. It produces files in the same format used by AutoCAD--DWG--which is also one of the most widely used design formats. Windows 7 Support Use a touch-enabled device with support for Microsoft Windows 7 multi-touch functionality, including flicks. What's New Numeric Entry Adjust the size of an object--line, rectangle, circle, or arc--by simply entering a measurement. It's much easier than dragging the object to an exact size. Flip Objects It's simpler to create symmetry. Make mirrored shapes by copying and then flipping objects vertically or horizontally. Erase Using Windows Selection Erase just a selected section of an object. DWG Support Open DWG files from AutoCAD software and other DWG-compatible applications. Scale Multiple Objects No more dragging individual objects of a complex drawing to adjust their size. Simply select all of the objects and drag to the desired size, or right-click on it and enter a percentage. Predrawn Content New symbols for trees, shrubs, stoves, and more help you draw faster than ever. Rotation Grip Gives you more control while rotating an object, and provides easier-to-read feedback. DWG Roundtrip Mode Buttons It's now easier to work with DWG files created in software other than AutoCAD Freestyle. New buttons allow you to toggle between the viewport mode and paper overlay mode so that you are always drawing to scale--even if your source DWG file is highly complex.\nDetails:\nlanguage: English\npackage_dimensions: 7.5 x 5.3 x 0.6 inches; 4 Ounces\nitem_model_number: CZ0858\ndate_first_available: April 29, 2010\nmanufacturer: Autodesk PSG\n\nTop Reviews:\n\n"

It's exciting that the naughty playmate is gonna have her own little baby. Dear, you should come and share the joy with her.Do you remember the old days that you hold the little fur-ball in arms to keep warm in cold winter? Sometimes she is really lazy since she loves to stretch out her legs on the sofa and enjoy a sunbath. Yes, she is a unique friend. If she wants you to pet her, she becomes a clingy girl. But when she has no interest in you, she won't even take a look at you. Haha~ that's really funny. Now she is gonna be a mommy and it's not an easy thing, but your love and care will definitely help her and her baby go through the important days. It's worthwhile to help the pets who always melt your heart, right?How to play:Open the game and start with the check-up for the mommy cat. Oops, she feels breathless, hurry to drag the oxygen mask to her mouth. Then we need to check the heartbeat. Ok, everything is normal. And let\u2019s do the B-ultrasonic examination.

After all, they have so many beneficial vitamins. And each of them is unlike the other. Red, blue, and green, large and small, hard and soft. Some are sweet, others sour, and still more are salty. You might think that each fruit has its own personality. Merry strawberries, clumsy cabbages, and carefree oranges. I wonder what they would be like if they could live among us? We decided to indulge our imaginations and presented each fruit in its own characteristic way. The result turned out to be very interesting and fun! Connect points is a learning puzzle for small children. It helps develop thinking, improve memory and attention. The application has three game modes: by numbers, letters and coloring. Game modes with letters and numbers will be useful for kindergarten and pre-K kids. Connecting by numbers will help to easily memorize the order of numbers and learn to count. To do this, you need to consecutively connect circles with numbers starting from 1. As you connect circles in the right order, the silhouette of a hidden picture will become more and more visible. If three points are chosen incorrectly, a tip will pop up. Once all the points are fully connected, the picture will become fully visible and you\u2019ll be able to color it.Those studying the alphabet can choose to connect points by letters. It is important that children know letters as early as possible, since it is essential for learning to read and write. But knowing the order of letters in the alphabet is also very important! This can be achieved by connecting circles with letters in the right sequence.The coloring mode will be especially appreciated by young artists. In this mode, you can proceed to coloring pictures without connecting points. To make the process even more exciting, you can change any predefined color. To do this, press and hold the paint bucket and choose the necessary color from the palette.\nDetails:\nrelease_date: 2015\ndate_first_listed_on_amazon: July 17, 2015\ndeveloped_by: Kedronic UAB\nsize: 28.5MB\nversion: 2.0\napplication_permissions: ['Open network sockets']\nminimum_operating_system: Android 4.1\napproximate_download_time: Less than 4 minutes\n\nTop Reviews:\n\n"

We know that many have wanted something like this for a while now.Random is the best way to describe what is happening in the audio... there really is no way to judge what will be said at the same time of a question.. The best thing about it is.. because it uses a more phonetic sound in the clips, we should be able to get foreign language usage & responses from it too.Just be warned its not for the faint hearted, this can be a terrifying experience if you have never touched a ghost box before so we recommend researching about the ghost box before deciding to try one for real.Simply click on \"Start\", this will open up the player and the sounds will start playing. When you have finished click the \"Back\" button on your device, this will take you back to the \"Start\" screen, from here it is safe to close the app down.you can change the sweep rate, or rate in which a sound is played, via the slider on the main screen.EVP Recorder----------------------The EVP Recorder allows you to record your spirit box session, or just record on its own.A folder is created on your device called \"SpottedGhosts\", in there you will find folders for all of our apps. Go into the \"SGK2\" folder, then into the \"Recordings\" folder, here you will find all your recordings as .3gp.You can also share your .3gp files via any app on your device that allows the sharing of 3gp (or audio) files.---------------------------------A handy tool to have for any Paranormal Investigations or Ghost Hunting Session!Please be aware, I am not stating that ghosts / spirits will 100% communicate with you through my app, but it has worked for me and many other people.Please be patient, I hope you get the answers you are looking for.** This app contains adverts **Yes we know, everyone hates adverts right?

Pro Plus Version 6 Features The biggest single addition to Starry Night software since its inception is now yours in the Pro Plus version 6.0--a full-color AllSky CCD image mosaic of the entire night sky visible from Earth--a picture so detailed, it weighs in at an astounding 6.44 billion pixels in size. Named AllSky for its uniform coverage from pole to pole, it's a single picture of the whole sky that has now been precisely mapped to Starry Night's computer generated stars and databases. Previously only available to Windows users through Desktop Universe planetarium software, the display of the AllSky image has been drastically improved in Starry Night and is now accessible to Mac users as well. Computer Images With Exquisite Detail With Pro Plus version 6.0, you can view on your computer screen an image better than the best-trained human eye can capture in real-time viewing through a telescope on a \"good seeing\" night. You'll be able to see the entire Milky Way in exquisite detail and then zoom in to explore dust lanes and nebulae. Instead of dots and circles, you will see an actual photo of a star or a deep sky object. Smooth and Swift Navigation With Pro Plus version 6.0, you'll smoothly and swiftly navigate the full color AllSky CC photograph of the entire night sky, to a limiting magnitude of 14-15. Five years in development, the AllSky CCD mosaic is comprised of about 20,000 individual images, originally imaged at a resolution of 12 arcseconds per pixel with a scientific grade, custom built AP9E CCD camera. The AllSky image in Starry Night presents the entire sky as a full-color, seamless mosaic at 5 resolution levels depending on your zoom setting. This consistent resolution, color and depth of coverage eliminates the uncertainties of comparing images from many and varied sources. Zoom from the widest possible view of 180 degrees to 0.5 degree field of view. If you have the processing power, set the AllSky image to be more precise and a better match between the photographic stars in the AllSky image and the Starry Night stars. For the highest quality AllSky image, you will need a video card with a minimum of 96 MB VRAM. Pro Plus version 6.0 includes an additional 6 GB of the AllSky image in DDS texture format, which enables the AllSky image to load up to 20 times faster. In addition, at wide fields of view, the AllSky image can be rendered via shaders for perfect rendering accuracy and a dramatic speed improvement, but you will need a higher-end OpenGL 2.0 capable graphics card to see this phenomenal improvement. A 128 MB nVidia GeForce 6600 (or higher) or ATI Radeon X800 (or higher) are recommended. In all, Starry Night Pro Plus version 6 has over 25 new features that bring more power and control to your observing and imaging. Starry Night Pro Plus will change how you look at the night sky.

Recipes your family and friends are sure to love!While Americanized Chinese food has long been a staple, more authentic Chinese dishes as well as traditional foods from other Asian countries are becoming more common on menus today. Among these dishes are Indian curries, which can be based on vegetables, fish, poultry or eggs, much like a stew. What sets a curry apart is the seasonings. For the uninitiated palate, a curry can be a good starting point for exploring Indian cuisine. Begin by using a delicate hand with a mild curry powder and you may find your first experience one of delight at the light and somewhat sweet flavor that a small amount of the seasoning imparts. For a more robust curry, use more; for more mildness, add the curry after cooking, since heat intensifies the flavor. If you find you prefer more spicy hotness, work your way up to hot madras curry powder or garam masala, authentic Indian curry powder.Curried Eggs and Peas is a good choice for a first sampling. Soothingly flavored eggs, peas and rice cut the bite of the sharper seasonings in curry powder, leaving a pleasantly mellow note. Give the finished dish more interest by topping it with chutney, raisins, nuts or shredded coconut, if you like.So, go ahead and get your free app on Chinese recipes now!\nDetails:\nrelease_date: 2012\ndate_first_listed_on_amazon: March 19, 2012\ndeveloped_by: bigo\nsize: 1.7MB\nversion: 1.0\napplication_permissions: ['Access information about networks', 'Open network sockets', 'Write to external storage']\nminimum_operating_system: Android 2.1\napproximate_download_time: Less than 30 seconds\n\nTop Reviews:\n\n"

Fetch gold, diamonds, and other treasure from mines out in the Old West using your trusty hook. Mining is tricky business, however, and it takes a good eye and steady hand to avoid TNT in the ground, and navigate your hook around ground hogs, animal bones, and rusty wheels.Based on the original arcade classic, Gold Mine HD introduces some new twists to this old favorite. In this version, each level is completely independent of the previous level, so you can always go back to where you left off without starting at the beginning. As you progress, you'll be asked to acquire more value from your mine, but you'll have more resources by which to do this, too.You may visit the General Store at any time to buy things for your miner, like dynamite, strength tonic, a rock field guide, and other fun things. In higher levels, you may purchase multiple items of the same type (like dynamite), and some speciality items that you'll find out about soon enough! Once you get past the 3rd or 4th level, you'll find that you often cannot pass a level at all unless you get some help from the store. That $100 bottle of tonic may be exactly what you need to give your miner a boost.Timing and coordination are key in this game that pits you against the clock as you race to reach your goal.Visit us on Facebook and share your achievements at:https://www.facebook.com/goldminegameThe \"HD\" version of Gold Mine features high-definition graphics which are ideally suited to the new Kindle Fire HD. The same version is playable on other Android devices, but the file size will still be large due to the large graphics files (about 20 MB).Important information regarding the Android permissions in Gold Mine HD:Gold Mine HD requires \"READ_PHONE_STATE\", \"ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\", and \"INTERNET\" permissions. Here is why:READ_PHONE_STATE: If you get a phone call or text-message or system alert of any time, Gold Mine pauses game play temporarily. This permission is needed to detect changes to the phone state in order to properly pause the game play.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE and INTERNET: These are required for Facebook connectivity with the Gold Mine Facebook page (optional, but fun if you have Facebook to share your score with your friends).Good luck prospecting!\nDetails:\nrelease_date: 2012\ndate_first_listed_on_amazon: October 13, 2012\ndeveloped_by: Darren Gates\nsize: 16.1MB\nversion: 1.0\napplication_permissions: ['Access information about networks', 'Open network sockets', 'Read only access to device state']\nminimum_operating_system: Android 2.2\napproximate_download_time: Less than 3 minutes\n\nTop Reviews:\n\n"
